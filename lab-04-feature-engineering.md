How many trees are in your city? It might seem like a straightforward question, but finding the answer can be a monumental task. New York Cityâ€™s 2015-2016 tree census, for example, took nearly two years (12,000 hours total) and more than 2,200 volunteers.

My research team has calculated just how much a tree matters for many urban areas, particularly megacities. Trees clean the air and water, reduce stormwater floods, improve building energy use, and mitigate climate change, among other things. For every dollar invested in planting, cities see an average $2.25 return on their investment each year.

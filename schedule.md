How much did Friedberg pay for the NOAA weather data? How much did his company sell for? What is the economic value of government data?

The value of public data will often be unlocked by private individuals or firms. What is the difference between Friedberg’s use of NOAA data and AcuWeather’s use of the data?

*** { @unit = "July 9th", @title = "LAB 1: Models of Neighborhood Change", @assignment, @foldout }

# Week 1 Lab

This week's lab will introduce you to two data-driven models of neighborhood change. We will use this case study over the next six weeks to discuss things like data needs for predictive models. You will be required to think critically about the data used in the labs, but you will not be responsible for things like the advanced analytical models in the paper. I am approaching the labs with the assumption that you are likely to be a manager hiring an analyst, so you need a high-level understanding of the models in order to find someone for the task. 

Read the following chapter and paper:

Market Value Analysis: A Data-Based Approach to Understanding Urban Housing Markets. pp 49-59 [ [PDF](https://github.com/DS4PS/paf-586-summer-2019/raw/master/Reading/MVA-DD-App-to-Strengthening-Neighborhoods.pdf) ]

**We are interesting in understanding neighborhood change. How did each author identify coherent "neighborhoods" (or groups) in each model? Did they use the same data to create the groups? How do the labels and descriptions of the groups differ in each model and why?**

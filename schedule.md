** Week 1 - The Promise of Data


*** { @unit = "", @title = "Course Overview", @lecture, @foldout }

## KEY COURSE THEMES

### The Promise of Big Data: 

In 2017 The Economist declared, "Data is to this century what oil was to the last one: a driver of growth and change. Flows of data have created new infrastructure, new businesses, new monopolies, new politics and – crucially – new economics."

In 2011 McKinsey & Co. described big data as "the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity.” 
GE looked to big data to drive "changes as profound as industrialization... in the late 1700s".

### [Challenges of Harnessing Data]( https://sloanreview.mit.edu/case-study/lessons-from-becoming-a-data-driven-organization/):

Many organizations have been slow in compiling, classifying, and organizing the data sitting in siloes and dark corners. It’s “a boring, boring job,” says Ger Baron, Amsterdam’s first-ever chief technology officer. “But very useful!” 

He ought to know. The Netherlands’ capital has 12,000 different datasets, and even they can’t tell him everything about the city. For example, no one knows exactly how many bridges span Amsterdam’s famous canals, because the city’s individual districts have not centralized their infrastructure data.

That story underscores the challenges organizations face in the realm of data governance, or the methods and rules that organizations use to assure the quality of data, manage it, integrate it into business processes, and manage its risks.

### [Abundant Data by Itself Solves Nothing](https://graymattersystems.com/cio-survey-reveals-challenges-opportunities-potential-industrial-big-data/ ):  

Despite the promise of big data, industrial enterprises are struggling to maximize its value. Why? Abundant data by itself solves nothing. Its unstructured nature, sheer volume, and variety exceed human capacity and traditional tools to organize it efficiently and at a cost which supports return on investment requirements. Inherent challenges tied to evolution and integration of industrial information and operational technology, make it difficult to glean intelligence from operational data, compromising projects underway and promise for further investment and value. 

### [Firms are years away from getting full value from their data assets](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/07/go_small_on_big_data/):  

Throwing cash at the problem isn't helping matters either. Companies need to scale back their ambitions to invest in projects that are more evolutionary than revolutionary in nature, looking to tweak rather than overhaul existing operational practices. In short, the best big data strategy may be to go small.

### [Effective Approaches](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/case-study/lessons-from-becoming-a-data-driven-organization/ ): 

It’s tough enough for many organizations to catalog and categorize the data at their disposal and devise the rules and processes for using it. It’s even tougher to translate that data into tangible value.

There would be no data and analytics revolution without easily accessible, increasingly inexpensive computing power: the cloud, the Internet, and powerful, versatile software and algorithms. Yet technology is only part of the story. People are equally important.

The technology and the people who deploy it also need a process or system of rules to guide how people create and use information. Rules help transform the noise of disordered information into legible signals with the power to sharpen and deepen the focus on the customer (broadly defined), and in the process improve health outcomes, the customer experience, the realization of business value, and civic life and engagement.

### [The Age of Big Data: New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html) 

A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired.

*** { @unit = "Due July 9th", @title = "LAB 1: Models of Neighborhood Change", @assignment, @foldout }

# Week 1 Lab

This week’s lab will introduce you to two data-driven models of neighborhood change. We will use this case study over the next six weeks to discuss things like data needs for predictive models. You will be required to think critically about the data used in the labs, but you will not be responsible for things like the advanced analytical models in the paper. I am approaching the labs with the assumption that you are likely to be a manager hiring an analyst, so you need a high-level understanding of the models in order to find someone for the task.

Neighborhood change is a complicated concept with a lot of loaded terminology. We might think about neighborhoods that are "revitalized", "gentrified", that are "stable", or that "decline".  We could spend an entire semester unpacking all of these constructs, but that is out of scope of the lab. Here we are more interested in how we might make sense of our data, and then once we have meaningful groups how we might use them to make predictions with the data. Can a city forecast how it's current neighborhoods are likely to change over the next decade, and can that help with urban planning processes? 

Read the following articles:

> Market Value Analysis: A Data-Based Approach to Understanding Urban Housing Markets. pp 49-59 [ [PDF](https://github.com/DS4PS/paf-586-summer-2019/raw/master/Reading/MVA-DD-App-to-Strengthening-Neighborhoods.pdf) ]

> Delmelle, E. C. (2017). Differentiating pathways of neighborhood change in 50 US metropolitan areas. Environment and planning A, 49(10), 2402-2424. [ [PDF](https://github.com/DS4PS/paf-586-summer-2019/raw/master/Reading/differentiating-pathways-of-neighborhood-change.pdf) ]

We are interesting in understanding neighborhood change. These data-driven approaches to the phenomenon use machine-learning algorithms to "discover" coherent communities within the city by grouping census tracks into groups that minimize within-group differences and maximize between-group differences. 

You can explore one of these algorithms by looking at examples of how botanists might create "species" based upon characteristics of flowers:

[Clustering Example](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/kmeans-example.html)

A data-driven approach to understanding neighborhood change requires use to (1) define "neighborhoods", or groups of census tracks in the data that are very similar, and (2) use those group characteristics at a point in time to predict how they "neighborhood" might change in the future. Both of the papers present variations on Step (1) above.

Read the two papers, then answer the following questions:

1. **How did each author identify coherent “neighborhoods” (or groups) in each model?**
2. **Would these "neighborhoods" line up with neighborhoods that are defined on a city's zoning maps (Links to an external site.)?**
3. **Did the two models use the same data to create the groups?**
4. **How do the labels and descriptions of the groups differ in each model and why?**

Write your responses in a word document, save your responses as a PDF and name your file LAB-01-YOUR-LAST-NAME.pdf, then submit it via the Canvas assignment tool. 

Concise and precise answers are preferred to meandering paragraphs! One page would be fine for this assignment.
